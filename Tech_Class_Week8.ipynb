For example, consider a loop that counts from 1 to 10 but prints only the odd numbers in that range. First, we set current_number to 0. Because it’s less than 10, Python enters the while loop. Once inside the loop, we increment the count by 1 , so current_number is 1. The if statement then checks the modulo of current_number and 2. If the modulo is 0 (which means current_number is divisible by 2), the continue statement tells Python to ignore the rest of the loop and return to the beginning. If the current number is not divisible by 2, the rest of the loop is executed and Python prints the current number:\n",

        "A for loop is effective for looping through a list, but you shouldn’t modify a list inside a for loop because Python will have trouble keeping track of the items in the list. To modify a list as you work through it, use a while loop. Using while loops with lists and dictionaries allows you to collect, store, and organize lots of input to examine and report on later."

        "\n",
        "##### **Problem:**\n",
        "In our blog analytics use case, most visit events come from a streaming broker in real time. But some of them are still being written to a transactional database by legacy producers.\n",
        "You need to create a dedicated data ingestion process to bring these legacy visits to the Bronze layer.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **Solution:**\n",
        "###### **Step 1:**\n",
        "Ask the interviewer whether each **visit record is immutable**. If the answer is yes, proceed to Step 2. If No, proceed to step 5.\n",
        "\n",
        "###### **Step 2:**\n",
        "Suggest starting with an **initial load** to bring in **historical dataset** covering a defined time period. After that, implement an **incremental loader** to handle subsequent data loads.\n",
        "\n",
        "###### **Step 3:**\n",
        "Since each visit is immutable, **we don’t need to capture updates or changes**. Instead, we simply **append new records** to the dataset in the Bronze layer. We can use a column such as creation time, load time, or another delta column (which represents when the event was ingested in the legacy system). This column will act as a watermark for the incremental loads.\n",
        "\n",
        "###### **Step 4:**\n",
        "If the legacy system supports **time-based partitions**, the process becomes even more efficient. In that case, we can simply load **one partition at a time** after it has been fully populated. We could just set an hourly batch job where on each hour a new partition starts to load with the previous one marked as ready or completed for the use of the stakeholders.\n",
        "\n",
        "###### **Step 5:**\n",
        "For a simpler example, let’s say event records are regularly deleted. Instead of physically removing them called hard delete, we can implement a soft delete by adding a deleted flag column (e.g., is_deleted = true). This way, we retain all records in the Bronze layer or Enterprise layer, while excluding the deleted ones from flowing into the Silver or Presentation layers."
