As a result, our overall while statement needs to check only one condition: whether the flag is currently True.

For example, consider a loop that counts from 1 to 10 but prints only the odd numbers in that range. First, we set current_number to 0. Because it’s less than 10, Python enters the while loop. Once inside the loop, we increment the count by 1 , so current_number is 1. The if statement then checks the modulo of current_number and 2. If the modulo is 0 (which means current_number is divisible by 2), the continue statement tells Python to ignore the rest of the loop and return to the beginning. If the current number is not divisible by 2, the rest of the loop is executed and Python prints the current number:\n",
